I used to distrust my online presence. I needed to have ownership and control of my content on social media platforms. So I quit. I would have rather shared nothing than have it be owned and manipulated by someone. 

After some time I began to realize that it's possible to have an online presence, own your creations and be independent. I'm happy to return to the web now in control of my content.
